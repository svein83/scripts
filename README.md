# websearch
Simple script to simplify adding of effortless web-search to any environment.

## this script currently uses:
hURL for URL work

yad for GUI interaction.

## Examples:
xfce4-appfinder

## ToDo:
Re-add the terminal output I removed.

Add support for xdg-open etc. and maybe a simple auto-search for a fallback-browser in path. 

Add support for zenity and notify-send.

Find alternatives to hURL. (script a simple one?)
