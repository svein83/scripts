# websearch
Just a script I use to add fast web-searches anywhere.

Why?
Because I missed the ability to use any search-engine simply by hitting a key-combo, typing a few words and hitting enter.

## this script currently uses:
hURL for URL work

yad for GUI interaction.

## Examples:
[google web-search from xfce4-appfinder](https://github.com/svein83/websearch/blob/master/examples.md#google-web-search)

[google image-search from xfce4-appfinder that lists only svg images](https://github.com/svein83/websearch/blob/master/examples.md#google-image-search-for-svg-files-only)

## ToDo:

Add example with bash aliases.

Use a case selector instead of all those if-blocks

Re-add the terminal output I removed.

Add support for xdg-open etc. and maybe a simple auto-search for a fallback-browser in path. 

Add support for zenity and notify-send.

Find alternatives to hURL. (or script a simple one?)
